This directory contains scripts to extract and transform records from other directories of data formats.

Run `make` or see `Makefile` for processing details.

## Data Type Registry

Contents of the [Data Type Registry](https://typeregistry.org/)(DTR) can be
downloaded in a custom JSON format. Records are locally stored in
`typeregistry.ndjson`. The concept of "data types" collected in this registry
does not directly map to data formats but more to conceptual entities and most
records lack examples.
